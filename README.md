# Bird-Plot

**Bird-Plot** is a Python-based visualization tool for generating quadrant-style plots of [tick.com.au](https://tick.com.au)’s four-bird personality styles (Eagle, Dove, Owl, and Peacock). It takes as input a data file (e.g., CSV) of individual or group personality scores and produces informative charts that help users quickly see:

- **Individual** personality radar plots
- **Team** or **group** distributions in a quadrant layout
- **Pairwise** comparisons (overlap of two individuals’ personalities)

These plots are especially useful for workshops, coaching sessions, and team-building exercises, as they visualize how individuals align or differ on the four “bird” dimensions.

[The Tick personality profiling system](https://tick.com.au) has been appreciated by many in the fields of sales training, leadership coaching, and personal development for its simplicity and ease of communication. Bird-Plot leverages this established framework to provide clear, accessible visualizations that help users understand and compare personality traits quickly. While the tool provides valuable insights and serves as a catalyst for discussion and reflection, users are encouraged to complement these insights with additional information and professional judgment.

## Features

- **Radar Plot** for individuals:

  - Shows how a single person’s personality scores map onto the four quadrants.
  - A polygon connecting each dimension’s score.

- **Team/Group Distribution**:

  - Plots multiple people on a quadrant-based chart, illustrating the distribution of personalities in a single view.
  - Useful for quickly identifying group strengths, diversity, and potential gaps.

- **Pairwise Comparison**:
  - Overlays two individuals’ radar polygons on the same chart to highlight similarities and differences.
  - Displays a percentage overlap for a quick gauge of alignment.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arapov/bird-plot.git
cd bird-plot
```

2. **Install Dependencies with Poetry**

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

```bash
poetry install
```

3. **(Optional) Activate the Virtual Environment**

```bash
poetry shell
```

Or you can use poetry run ... without activating the shell.

4. **Verify Installation**

```bash
poetry run bird-plot --help
```

This should display a help message with usage instructions.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   Ensure you have a CSV or similar data file that includes each person’s scores. (See [Input Data Format](#input-data-format) below.)

2. **Run Bird-Plot**

```bash
poetry run bird-plot --data data.csv --graph radar scatter
```

- --data Path to the CSV data file (default: data.csv)
- --graph Type of graph to generate (radar or scatter)

3. **Check Generated Plots**

The script will create .png files in the charts folder.

_Note: Run `poetry run bird-plot --help` for detailed usage._

## Input Data Format

| Name  | Dove | Eagle | Owl | Peacock | Note |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | --- | ------- | ---- |
| Grace | 15   | 12    | 5   | 17      | P/D  |
| Henry | 4    | 10    | 12  | 0       | O/E  |
| ...   | ...  | ...   | ... | ...     | ...  |

- **Name**: The individual’s name or identifier.
- **Dove, Eagle, Owl, Peacock**: Numeric scores representing each “bird” trait.
- **Note**: Individual's primary and secondary dominant "bird" traits, separated by a forward slash.

## Example Outputs

1. **Individual Radar Plot**

- Plots one person’s scores around four axes (Eagle, Dove, Owl, Peacock).
- The polygon edges connect each axis’s numeric value, visually representing personality strengths.

2. **Group/Team Distribution - Scatter Plot**

- Displays multiple names on a quadrant chart.
- Each quadrant corresponds to a “bird” style, with positions indicating how strongly each person aligns to one or more dimensions.

3. **Comparison/Overlap Plot**

- Overlays two radar plots for a side-by-side comparison.
- Shows an “Overlap” percentage as a measure of similarity.
